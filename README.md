Apex
==============
Apex optimizes the JVC + HD Fury Macro experience.

For those not familiar, the JVC RS500/RS600 models have the tech specs to support HDR very well, but JVC provided a truly terrible implementation. Amazing people on AVS have come up with ways to get HDR working on these projectors. One part of this involves using an HDFury product, such as the Vertex 2, to send macro commands via RS232 and cause the JVC to select appropriate HDR (or non-HDR) profile. Apex optimizes this step.
